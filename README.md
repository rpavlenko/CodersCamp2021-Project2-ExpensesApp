### About Project

"Scrooge" is a budget Web application developed with the idea to help potential users make the best decisions with their money. Design of Scrooge was designed to be as simple as possible.

- create/edit/delete incomes and expenses
- categorization (custom categories)
- possibility to add attachment (eg. bills) to the account (not implemented yet)
- setting alarms for budget limits
- creating simple chart based on category

### Main Page

Main page is full of features. Table at the top shows your current budget, then you have the possibility to add new income/expense using "+" button. Separate section show the list of user's inputs and few options of filtering user data (by name, date range or category). Categories can be scrolled from left to right.
At the bottom there are user records (incomes or expenses). Regarding limited space there is possibility to load more records by selecting "Pokaż więcej". Each record can be edited or removed.

Navigation is simplified and icon-based which increase accessability. It is available only after login/registration of the user. For mobile version navigation bar changes into hamburger menu.
